Answer: We have different hair colors because of tiny things in our bodies called genes. These genes are like special instructions that we get from our parents.
Inside each hair, there's a special coloring called melanin. If your hair has lots of melanin, it looks dark brown or black. If it has less melanin, it might be blonde. 
Your hair color depends on which genes you got from your mom and dad. That's why sometimes children have hair that looks like one parent, or sometimes it's a mix of both! As we get older, some people's hair might change color or turn gray when their bodies stop making as much melanin.
