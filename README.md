# Deep Learning for Natural Language Processing Coursework

Please note that the original repo became unusable after an issue with an early commit that became difficult to amend. 
Therefore, please note that there were several commit before the creation of this repo hence why it appears so recent. 

## Running the Notebooks

For computational reasons, Google Colab has been used to carry out the work in this study. Two separate notebooks have been created for the separate models, AllGradesModel.ipynb and SchoolGroupsModel.ipynb. The correct files will need to be uploaded to the workspace before running, these can be found in the datasets folder. Please use an A100 GPU as it is the only one with sufficient RAM to run the models.

## Results
To view the raw results from the evaluators, navigate to the results folder. To view plots of this data, view the extract_results.ipynb.
